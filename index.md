I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by Prof. Stephen Pizer (<a href="http://midag.cs.unc.edu">lab website</a>). My research is focused on using computer vision, shape statistics, and 3D reconstruction to improve colonoscopy as a tool for cancer screening.

I received my M.S. in computer science in 2023 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously, I graduated in 2021 from Case Western Reserve University with a B.A. in physics and computer science, and from the Montgomery Blair High School Magnet in 2017. I expect to complete my Ph.D. in the 2025-26 school year, and from then pursue a career as an applied scientist.

Apart from academics, I enjoy hiking, 3D printing, and cooking.
