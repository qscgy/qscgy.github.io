<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, advised by Prof. Stephen Pizer. My research is focused on using computer vision, deep learning, and 3D reconstruction to improve colonoscopy as a tool for cancer screening.</p>

<p>Originally from Silver Spring, Maryland, I graduated from the Montgomery Blair HS Magnet program in 2017. In 2021 I earned my Bachelor of Arts from Case Western Reserve University, with a double major in physics and computer science. I am set to receive my M.S. in computer science from UNC in May 2023, and will remain at the university to complete my Ph.D with an expected completion date sometime in 2025.</p>

<p>Apart from academics, I enjoy hiking, photography, and cooking.</p>
