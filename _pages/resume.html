<p>Advisor: Stephen M. Pizer</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a novel approach to visual navigation, combining deep learning and computational geometry, in order to enable placement of an endoscope with an accuracy of 3 cm.</li>
<li>Collaborated with a team to devise and implement a novel, Vision Transformer‑based method of monocular depth estimation in the irregular domain of medical endoscopy, achieving competitive or superior performance against existing methods.</li>
<li>Developed a trainable image‑processing pipeline to detect texture‑invariant geometric features in endoscopic video, outperforming the state of the art by 30 percentage points on overall accuracy. Optimized this approach to be able to process 110 frames per second.</li>
