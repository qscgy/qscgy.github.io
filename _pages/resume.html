of North Carolina at Chapel Hill — Chapel Hill, NC</h4>
<p>Advisor: Stephen M. Pizer</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a novel, primarily geometric approach to visual navigation
in order to enable placement of an endoscope with an accuracy of 3
cm.</li>
<li>Collaborated with a team to devise and implement a novel, Vision
Transformer‑based method of monocular depth estimation in the irregular
domain of medical endoscopy, achieving competitive or superior
performance against existing methods.</li>
<li>Developed a trainable image‑processing pipeline to detect
texture‑invariant geometric features in endoscopic video, outperforming
the state of the art by 30 percentage points on overall accuracy.
Optimized this approach to be able to process 110 frames per
second.</li>
<li>Used Qt and VTK to continue development of an interactive
post‑processing tool for 3D reconstructions.</li>
<li>Performed extensive testing and debugging on a shared codebase.</li>

<h4 id="case-western-reserve-university-cleveland-oh-1">Case Western
Reserve University — Cleveland, OH</h4>
<p>Advisor: Mahdi Bayat</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed a novel method, employing deep learning and numerical
image processing, to produce images of blood vessels under 1 mm diameter
from ultrasound scans without the need for injected contrast
agents.</li>
<li>Introduced a novel method for fast low‑rank approximation of
spatiotemporal data in applications where speed is prioritized over
accuracy. Demonstrated superior performance to comparable,
previously‑published methods.</li>
<li>Used MATLAB to implement a blood‑vessel simulator to simulate
ultrasound scans of a shear‑thinning fluid flowing through winding,
narrow blood vessels.</li>
