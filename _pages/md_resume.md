Graduate Research Assistant (Advisor: Stephen M. Pizer) University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chapel Hill, NC Aug 2021 - Present

::: cvitems
Developed a novel, primarily geometric approach to visual navigation in
order to enable placement of an endoscope with an accuracy of 3 cm.

Collaborated with a team to devise and implement a novel, Vision
Transformer-based method of monocular depth estimation in the irregular
domain of medical endoscopy, achieving competitive or superior
performance against existing methods.

Developed a trainable image-processing pipeline to detect
texture-invariant geometric features in endoscopic video, outperforming
the state of the art by 30 percentage points on overall accuracy.
Optimized this approach to be able to process 110 frames per second.

Used Qt and VTK to continue development of an interactive
post-processing tool for 3D reconstructions.

Performed extensive testing and debugging on a shared codebase.

Undergraduate Research Assistant (Advisor: Mahdi Bayat) Case Western
Reserve University Cleveland, OH Apr 2020 - Aug 2021

::: cvitems
Developed a novel method, employing deep learning and numerical image
processing, to produce images of blood vessels under 1 mm diameter from
ultrasound scans without the need for injected contrast agents.

Introduced a novel method for fast low-rank approximation of
spatiotemporal data in applications where speed is prioritized over
accuracy. Demonstrated superior performance to comparable,
previously-published methods.

Used MATLAB to implement a blood-vessel simulator to simulate ultrasound
scans of a shear-thinning fluid flowing through winding, narrow blood
vessels.

Tool for visualizing the geometric properties of 3D shapes Shape Viewer
2024-present

::: cvitems
Used PyVista, Sympy, and Numpy to to create a cross-platform educational
app for visualizing the geometric properties of surfaces.

This project is an attempt to make an updated, cross-platform version of
Shapemonger, an old Windows application that was the only option
availabe to visualize surface properties important in differential
geometry.

Features include:

-   visualization of local and global shape properties

-   plotting of Gauss maps and asymptotic spherical maps

-   a customizable plotting system

-   a library of example shape plots highlighting key concepts in
    differential geometry

The code is available at <https://github.com/qscgy/shape-viewer>.

::: cvitems
Budgeted university funds and coordinated with caterers and facilities
services to host biweekly tea times, 4 offsite dinners and 4 lunches for
60 people each, and one family-friendly evening social for 100 people.

In spring 2024, held 150% more department social events than in any of
the previous four semesters.

Advocated for the views and interests of students during the faculty
hiring process as a voting member of the departmental faculty senate.

Successfully advocated to maintain a cost-of-living increase for
graduate student stipends.
