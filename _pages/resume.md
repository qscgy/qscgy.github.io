## Experience
### Graduate Research Assistant 
(Advisor: Stephen M. Pizer)<br>
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC<br>Aug 2021 - Present

- Developed a novel approach to the problem of visual navigation in endoscopy in order to enable an endoscopist to navigate the tip of the
endoscope to within 3 cm of a designated point.
- Collaborated with a team to devise and implement a novel method of monocular video depth estimation in the irregular domain of medical
endoscopy, achieving competitive or superior performance against existing methods.
- Developed a trainable image‑processing pipeline to detect texture‑invariant geometric features in endoscopic video, outperforming the state
of the art by 30 percentage points on overall accuracy. Optimized this approach to be able to process 110 frames per second.
- Used Qt and VTK to further develop an bespoke, interactive post‑processing tool for SLAM algorithms.
- Performed extensive testing and debugging on a shared codebase.

### Undergraduate Research Assistant<br>
(Advisor: Mahdi Bayat)<br>Case Western
Reserve University, Cleveland, OH<br> Apr 2020 - Aug 2021

- Developed a novel method, employing deep learning and numerical image processing, to produce images of blood vessels under 1 mm diameter
from ultrasound scans without the need for injected contrast agents.
- Introduced a novel method for fast low‑rank approximation of spatiotemporal data in applications where speed is prioritized over accuracy.
Demonstrated superior performance to comparable, previously‑published methods.
- Used MATLAB to implement a blood‑vessel simulator to simulate ultrasound scans of a shear‑thinning fluid flowing through winding, narrow blood vessels.

### REU Research Assistant<br>(Advisors: Ryan Kastner and Curt Schurgers)
University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA<br>June 2019 - Aug 2019

- Employed transfer learning to map the extent and health of mangroves
using aerial photography.

- Participated in data collection in Baja California Sur, Mexico, by
flying drones and exploring mangrove forests on foot.

## Projects
### Portfolio of data visualization
Chapel Hill, NC 2023-present

- Created various visualizations of data for my own curiosity. Most use
Altair, but some are with D3.js. Subjects include voting patterns, origins of the names of states, and US public universities.
- Code and plots: [https://github.com/qscgy/visualizations](https://github.com/qscgy/visualizations)

### COMP 755 - Machine Learning Project
In collaboration with: Mahathir
Monjur, Sharmin Akhtar, Ken Liu

**DEQ-GAN: Deep
Equilibrium Networks for Image Generation**
<br>Chapel Hill, NC Fall 2021

- Utilized Deep Equilibrium Networks (DEQ), a type of network that uses a
root-finding algorithm to approximate the steady state of an
infinitely-deep network, as the generator of a GAN.

- Demonstrated the viability of this method across several generative
domains, including faces, dogs, and Pokémon.
