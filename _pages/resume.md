## Experience
### Graduate Research Assistant 
(Advisor: Stephen M. Pizer)<br>
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC<br>Aug 2021 - Present

- Worked with coauthors to design and implement a novel method of
monocular depth estimation for endoscopy. Demonstrated competitive or superior performance to the state-of-the-art method on a number of
metrics.

- Proposed and implemented a novel algorithm for estimating the position
and area of occluded surface in colonoscopy.

- Developed image-processing methods to perform weakly-supervised semantic
segmentation of geometric features of the colon surface, outperforming
the state of the art by 30 percentage points on overall accuracy.

### Undergraduate Research Assistant<br>
(Advisor: Mahdi Bayat)<br>Case Western
Reserve University, Cleveland, OH<br> Apr 2020 - Aug 2021

- Developed a novel method, employing deep learning and numerical image
processing, for producing images of blood vessels under 1mm diameter
from ultrasound scans without contrast agents.

- Demonstrated the competitive performance of a novel method for fast
low-rank approximation of spatiotemporal data.

### REU Research Assistant<br>(Advisors: Ryan Kastner and Curt Schurgers)
University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA<br>June 2019 - Aug 2019

- Employed transfer learning to map the extent and health of mangroves
using aerial photography.

- Participated in data collection in Baja California Sur, Mexico, by
flying drones and exploring mangrove forests on foot.

## Projects
### Portfolio of data visualization
Chapel Hill, NC 2023-present

- Created various visualizations of data for my own curiosity. Most use
Altair, but some are with D3.js. Subjects include voting patterns, origins of the names of states, and US
public universities.

### COMP 790 - Shape Representation and Statistics Project 
**S-reps in Curved Space for Frame-to-Frame Alignment**<br>Chapel
Hill, NC Spring 2023

- Proposed and implemented a novel algorithm for constructing skeletal
representations (S-reps) of shapes defined on curved surfaces, i.e. 2D
manifolds embedded in 3D space.

- Demonstrated the potential of this method for downstream tasks,
including frame-to-frame camera pose estimation.

### COMP 790 - Neural Rendering Project
In collaboration with: Nurislam
Tursynbek

**URAGAN: Medical Image Registration
With StyleGAN 2**<br>Chapel Hill, NC Fall 2022

- Trained StyleGAN 2, along with latent-space encoders, to learn a latent
space in which the function warping one image to another is linear. When
decoded, this provides a warping function for even out-of-domain images.

- Achieved comparable in-domain and out-of-domain results to
state-of-the-art methods.

- Code: <https://github.com/NurislamT/URAGAN>

### COMP 755 - Machine Learning Project
In collaboration with: Mahathir
Monjur, Sharmin Akhtar, Ken Liu

**DEQ-GAN: Deep
Equilibrium Networks for Image Generation**
<br>Chapel Hill, NC Fall 2021

- Utilized Deep Equilibrium Networks (DEQ), a type of network that uses a
root-finding algorithm to approximate the steady state of an
infinitely-deep network, as the generator of a GAN.

- Demonstrated the viability of this method across several generative
domains, including faces, dogs, and Pok√©mon.
