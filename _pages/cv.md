- Implementing place re‑recognition in colonoscopy, which has low‑texture scenes with non‑static geometry.
- Proposed and implemented a novel algorithm for detecting occlusion boundaries in optical colonoscopy.
- Building a user interface for alerting a colonoscopist, during the colonoscopy procedure, to an unseen area of the colon and guiding them back to examine it.
- Developed image‑processing methods using deep learning in PyTorch to perform weakly‑supervised semantic segmentation of geometric fea‑ tures of the colon surface, outperforming the state of the art by 30 percentage points on overall accuracy.
- Explored the use of Swin Transformers on 3D point clouds for registering 3D reconstructions of internal organs.
- Used transfer learning to filter colonoscopy video frames in real time in order to remove those which do not contribute new information to a SLAM system.
