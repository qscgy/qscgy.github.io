My name is Sam Ehrenstein. I'm 23 years old and currently in my second year of a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research is focused on the use of machine learning to improve the accuracy of colonoscopy. I'm also an amateur photographer ([portfolio](/portfolio/)).
