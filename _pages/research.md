My current work with Prof. Stephen Pizer at UNC-Chapel Hill is focused on the use of computer vision, machine learning, and 3D reconstruction to improve the accuracy of colonoscopy. I am also working with Prof. Roni Sengupta on developing monocular depth and pose estimation methods for use with video of low-texture, non-rigid environments.

Previously I worked with Prof. Mahdi Bayat of Case Western Reserve University studying non-contrast ultrasound signal processing. Before that, I worked with Prof. Corbin Covault, also of CWRU, to investigate the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (on the order of 1 EeV energy, which is similar to the kinetic energy of a thrown baseball but in a single subatomic particle).
